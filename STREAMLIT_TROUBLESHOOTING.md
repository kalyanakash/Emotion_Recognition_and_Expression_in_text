# 🔧 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Requirements.txt Optimization
- **Problem**: Specific package versions causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Updated to use version ranges for better compatibility
- **Changes Made**:
  ```
  streamlit>=1.28.0
  pandas>=1.5.0
  numpy>=1.21.0
  tensorflow>=2.10.0,<2.16.0
  scikit-learn>=1.0.0
  plotly>=5.0.0
  ```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Problem**: App crashes if model files are missing
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling and caching
- **Features Added**:
  - `@st.cache_data` for training data loading
  - `@st.cache_resource` for model and tokenizer loading
  - Graceful error messages for missing files
  - Multiple weight file fallback support

### 3. Model Loading Improvements
- **Problem**: Model weights file inconsistency
- **Solution**: Added support for multiple weight file formats
- **Supported Files**:
  - `model_weights.h5`
  - `model_weights.weights.h5`

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Use Fixed Requirements (Recommended)
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud app dashboard
2. Click "Reboot app" or "Deploy" 
3. The app will now use the updated `requirements.txt`

### Option 2: Force Clean Deployment
1. Delete the current app from Streamlit Cloud
2. Create a new app with these settings:
   - **Repository**: `kalyanakash/Emotion_Recognition_and_Expression_in_text`
   - **Branch**: `master`
   - **Main file**: `app.py`

### Option 3: Alternative Requirements File
If still having issues, manually edit requirements in Streamlit Cloud to:
```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
tensorflow-cpu>=2.10.0,<2.16.0
scikit-learn
plotly
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" Error
**Solution**: Ensure all files are in the repository root:
- `app.py`
- `train.txt`
- `model_architecture.json`
- `model_weights.h5` or `model_weights.weights.h5`

### Issue: Memory Limit Exceeded
**Solution**: The app now uses `tensorflow-cpu` instead of full TensorFlow to reduce memory usage.

### Issue: Model Loading Fails
**Solution**: The app now provides detailed error messages and tries multiple weight file formats.

## 📁 Required Files Checklist
✅ `app.py` - Main application
✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
✅ `train.txt` - Training data for tokenizer
✅ `model_architecture.json` - Model structure
✅ `model_weights.h5` - Model weights
✅ `README.md` - Documentation

## 🔄 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Streamlit Cloud Logs**:
   - Go to your app dashboard
   - Click "Manage app"
   - Check the "Terminal" tab for detailed error messages

2. **Verify File Presence**:
   - Ensure all required files are in the GitHub repository
   - Check file sizes (model files should be significant in size)

3. **Contact Support**:
   - If the issue persists, the error logs will help identify the specific problem
   - Share the terminal output for more targeted assistance

## 🌟 Expected App Features After Deployment

- Modern glassmorphism UI design
- Real-time emotion detection
- Interactive confidence charts
- Emotion distribution visualizations
- Session history tracking
- Mobile-responsive design

Your app should now deploy successfully! 🎉
